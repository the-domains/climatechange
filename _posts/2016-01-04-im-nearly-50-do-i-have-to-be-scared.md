Hi.  I'm Jo.  I'm living in Belgium.  I'm a father of 3 and will be 50 in a couple of weeks.

It seems time for reflexion.  Not about the age, retracting hairline or wrinkles.

I'm worried about the climate change.  I'm asking myself - with all the bad news about temperature rising, massive floodings announcing the drowning of Holland and Belgium, from disappearing ice sheets to rising temperature to megadroughts - do we need to be scared ?  Do my children need to be scared ?  In what a world they will live ?
